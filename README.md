## General Notes

* **Variable Notation** - because this notebook is a collection of examples from all kinds of programming paradigms, a common variable notation is bound to clash with at least some languages and tools. See list below for a few examples. That's why this project is going to use a special notation of [Guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet), like so `«variable»`. To type these character, press <kbd>option</kbd><kbd>(shift)</kbd><kbd>backslash (\\)</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>0171</kbd> and <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>0187</kbd> on Windows.
  * `<variable>` clashes with XML
  * `[variable]` clashes with arrays/lists
  * `{variable}` clashes with objects/scopes
  * `(variable)` clashes with mathematical operations
